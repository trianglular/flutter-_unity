# ComeUnity


## Web Interface (React)


Education system has been stagnant and has lacked innovation for a long time and we aim to change that for a better overall experience with increased efficiency and interest for both teaching and learning in all fields. We aim to provide a one stop solution for online learning: a community based online platform for sharing and gaining knowledge in the most advanced yet friendly way.

The idea behind our project, ComeUnity is to basically provide a platform for people from all fields to explore and share knowledge related to their interests and skills. Users get to choose their fields of interests, post blogs, issues, or project requests and view similar posts on their feed. Here, you can get to learn as well as teach in addition to sharing knowledge and generating ideas only to learn and discover even more amazing stuff. Weâ€™ll also provide features wherein you can upload and watch video lectures on topics of your pursuit and even chat with other users. All of this will help create a sense of online community support among the users.

Additionally, to bridge the gap between the students and instructors, interactive learning using AR-VR based 3D models would also be a highlight of our project. Users will get to view 3D model visualisations on topics being taught at various age groups and education levels. This would help learners to inculcate difficult concepts easily and make learning more engaging, increasing conceptual understanding and enjoyable by incorporating interactable objects and models.
